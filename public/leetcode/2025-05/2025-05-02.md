We can split this questions into cases depending on where the .'s are:

1. ...L     => all . turn to L
2. ...R     => all . keep the same
3. L...L    => all . turn to L
4. L...R    => all . keep the same
5. R...L    => first half turn to R | second half turn to L
6. R...R    => all . turn to R
7. L...     => all . keep the same
8. R...     => all . turn to R

We iterate through the array, and if we see a ".", we keep track of the char before the . and char after the ..
Then we just change the .'s based on the above rules.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def pushDominoes(self, dominoes):
        """
        :type dominoes: str
        :rtype: str
        """
        # start right
        # -> end right -> convert everything to right
        # -> end left  -> convert half to left
        #              -> convert half to right
        #              -> if odd -> middle one stays '-'
        # -> EOF       -> all right
        # start left   
        # -> end left  -> convert everything to left
        # -> end right -> everything stays as is
        # -> EOF       -> leave as is

        domino_list = [char for char in dominoes]
        curr = "L"
        startIndex = -1
        for i in range(len(domino_list)):
            char = domino_list[i]
            if char == ".":
                if startIndex == -1:
                    startIndex = i
            else:
                if startIndex != -1:
                    if curr == "R":
                        if char == "R":
                            for index in range(startIndex, i):
                                domino_list[index] = "R"
                        else:
                            middle_diff = (i - startIndex) // 2 # 3 4 5 6 7 
                            offset = 1 if (i - startIndex) % 2 == 1 else 0
                            # 8 - 3 = 5 // 
                            for index in range(startIndex, startIndex + middle_diff):
                                domino_list[index] = "R"
                            for index in range(startIndex + middle_diff + offset, i):
                                domino_list[index] = "L"
                    if curr == "L":
                        if char == "L":
                            for index in range(startIndex, i):

                    startIndex = -1
                curr = char

        if startIndex != -1 and curr == "R":
            for i in range(startIndex, len(domino_list)):
                domino_list[i] = "R"

        return "".join(domino_list)
