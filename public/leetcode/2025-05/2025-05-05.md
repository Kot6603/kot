This one, despite being a medium, was pretty difficult. It's pretty easy to see that it is a dynamic programming problem but the recursive solution was hard to find.

The recursion uses the `[i - 1]` and `[i - 3]` solution to calculate the `[i]`th solution.

Rip me :pray:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numTilings(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        mod = 10**9 + 7
        if n <= 1:
            return 1
        if n == 2:
            return 2
        if n == 3:
            return 5
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0], dp[1], dp[2], dp[3] = 1, 1, 2, 5
        for i in range(4, n+1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i-1]*2 + dp[i-3]) % mod
        return dp[n]
```
