Given that it is an easy question and the highest number possible is `10^4`, we can brute force the solution.

We just iterate through all the possible integers from `low` to `high` and we skip all integers that have odd number of digits. If the number of digits is even, we sum up the first `n/2` digits and the last `n/2` digits. If the sums are equal to each other, we add 1 to the count. We return the count at the end.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSymmetricIntegers(self, low, high):
        """
        :type low: int
        :type high: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        count = 0
        for i in range(low, high + 1):
            if len(str(i)) % 2 == 1:
                continue

            n = len(str(i))
            first = sum([int(x) for x in list(str(i)[:n / 2])])
            second = sum([int(x) for x in list(str(i)[n / 2:])])
            if first == second:
                count += 1
        return count
```
