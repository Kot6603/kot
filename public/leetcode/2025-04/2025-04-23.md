This took me way too long or wha-

This is a very brute force method waowaoaowoaowao. 
Just go through all of the digits from `1` to `n` and keep track of a counter for the sum of digits.
Then we can iterate through the counter and count the number of entries with the largest value.

We return this count.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countLargestGroup(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        hashmap = {}

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            string = str(i)
            c = 0
            for digit in string:
                c += int(digit)

            hashmap[c] = hashmap.get(c, 0) + 1

        maximum = max(hashmap.values())
        count = 0
        for v in hashmap.values():
            if v == maximum:
                count += 1

        return count
```
