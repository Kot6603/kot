Classic sliding window problem, I feel like we've had a lot of sliding window this month.

In our window, we keep track of the number of `max` element inside the current window. We extend the window (increment `r`) until this number is equal to `k`. Then the number of valid subarrays starting at `l` is equal to `len(nums) - r + 1` and we can move onto the next `l`. Just the classic sliding window pattern...

We can return the total number of valid subarrays once we go through all possible `l`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSubarrays(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(nums)
        maximum_element = max(nums)
        r = 0
        count = 0
        res = 0
        for l in range(n):
            if l > 0:
                if nums[l - 1] == maximum_element:
                    count -= 1
            while r < len(nums) and count < k:
                if nums[r] == maximum_element:
                    count += 1
                r += 1
            if count >= k:
                res += n - r + 1
        return res
```
