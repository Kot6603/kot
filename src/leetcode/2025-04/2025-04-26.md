EW not a hard question D:.
This one is basically like a sliding window approach where we keep track of the index of the last invalid element (element that falls outside of the range), the last `minK` element and the last `maxK` element.

Using these indexes, we can calculate how many valid subarrays there are that contain the current index.
Calculating this is pretty simple, we need to include `minK` or `maxK` so we take the lower index of the two and we CANNOT include the invalid element. So `min(minK, maxK) - invalid` is the number of valid subarrays (if this is negative, there are no valid subarrays).

We add the number of valid subarrays and return the result.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def countSubarrays(self, nums, minK, maxK):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type minK: int
        :type maxK: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0
        invalid = -1
        maxi = -1
        mini = -1

        for i, val in enumerate(nums):
            if not minK <= val <= maxK:
                invalid = i
            if val == minK:
                mini = i
            if val == maxK:
                maxi = i
            
            valid = min(mini, maxi)
            res += max(0, valid - invalid)

        return res
```
