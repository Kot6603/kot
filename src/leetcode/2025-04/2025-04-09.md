One of the most confusing descriptions I've seen in a while. After reading the question very very very carefully, we can see that there are only 3 cases to consider when comparing the smallest element in `nums` and `k`:
1. If the smallest element in `nums` is smaller than `k`, it is not possible to make all values in the array equal to `k` as there are no operations that increase the value of elements in the array. Therefore, in this case, we return `-1`
2. If the smallest element in `nums` is greater than `k`, we would need to use 1 operation for each unique element in the list. Therefore, we would need to use `len(unique)` operations where `unique` is a list/set of unique elements in `nums`
3. If the smallest element in `nums` is equal to `k`, we have a similar case to case 2, except we don't need to use an operation at the end (since `k` is equal to the smallest element in `nums`). Therefore, we would need to use `len(unique) - 1` operations where `unique` is a list/set of unique elements in `nums` 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minOperations(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        unique = set(nums)
        smallest = float('inf')
        for num in unique:
            smallest = min(smallest, num)

        if smallest < k:
            return -1
        if smallest > k:
            return len(unique)

        return len(unique) - 1
```
